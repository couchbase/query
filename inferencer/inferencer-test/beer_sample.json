You will spot it at the banks of the Drammen River at the very same place as it has been since 1834. The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.",

The \"Gulatinglov\", one of the first Norwegian laws written in the 9th century, has a chapter on brewing beer for the midwinter celebration in January. The festivities were held to celebrate the Norse Gods; Odin, Frøy and Njord as well as the \"return\" of the sun.\r\nFurthermore, the tradition was adopted by the Vikings that brought Christianity to the country between 1000 and 1100. They moved the tradition to December in connection with the birth of Jesus. \r\nIn those days a farmer that did not set aside the best crop to produce the beer could lose his house to the king and the church. The law has been changed, but we promise you that we still use the very best of malt, yeast, hops, and pure Norwegian water to produce our Christmas beer.\r\n\r\nAass Juleøl has won most of the Norwegian Juleøl taste test conducted over time.

We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100 seat brew pub) and were forced to move up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand. Today, we brew over 62,000 barrels of beer and 3,000 barrels of root beer, and we're still growing! But don't let our growth fool you. Our lagers and ales are still brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews. Abita uses only the finest ingredients  British and American barley, German yeast, European and Washington State hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs. In Abita, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way. Abita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes. We're proud of our brewery and the beers we make. Try Abita Beer today and taste a bit of the South!",

At only 3.7% alcohol, Adnams Bitter is the classic English 'ordinary,' though we think you'll agree that there's full of flavor.\r\n\r\nDespite its rich heritage and enduring fame, Adnams is not a company willing to rest on its laurels. Its continued commitment to quality and innovative packaging designs has made it Britain’s fastest growing brewery over the last two years. To top it off, Adnams’ head brewer was recently chosen as Britain’s Brewer of the Year by a panel of his peers.",

    "description": "The popularity of our beers has led to heroic efforts to keep up with the demand. We claim the unofficial record for production on a 10 barrel brewing system, with a whopping 42 batches in a single week. The addition of a new, 100-barrel brewhouse in 1995, and a Sankey-type keg system installed the following year, finally made it possible for us to serve the entire Pacific Northwest and later the Desert Southwest.  Brewing beer in Alaska isn't easy. In the coastal community of Juneau, without road connections to the lower 48 states, everything arrives and leaves by water or air, and the weather always has the last word.  We have learned to coordinate shipments for barges that couldn't dock in high winds, ferries that broke down, airplanes that overheaded, and trucks delayed by spring thaws that turned the roads to mush. We learned which suppliers were willing to airlift supplies and spare parts on short notice (at $1 per pound). We mastered wiring, plumbing, waste disposal and air quality control. We discovered that, if you had to, you could pour concrete in January by thawing the ground with heaters. Ah, but it all seems worthwhile if you can go home to a dinner of king crab or fresh halibut.",

Our water originates in the 1,500-square-mile Juneau Ice Field and from the more than 90 inches of rainfall we receive each year.",

    "description": "Allagash Brewing Company sold its first batch of beer in the summer of 1995. The Allagash story, however, has roots that go much further back then the ten years the Portland, Maine brewery has been in operation. The roots go into the early 1990's when founder Rob Tod saw something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels, Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public. He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales. Allagash began with the release of its Allagash White, modeled after the traditional White beers of Belgium. Also referred to as wit beers, they get their unique flavor from the use of wheat in place of barley, Curacao orange peel and the careful sprinkling of coriander and other spices. Allagash combined these ingredients with their very own proprietary Belgian yeast strain to create the remarkably unique and refreshing beer that is today their flagship brand. Allagash White developed a strong cult following around the Portland area where it was available at selected draft accounts. Due to its immediate success, the beer was soon made available in 12-ounce six-packs throughout the state of Maine. With the success of the first brand, Rob realized two things: The public was asking for some new styles and the workload was getting to be too much for one person. Soon after, two experienced brewers were hired and Allagash released their second brew, Allagash Double Ale. Using the philosophy and techniques created by the Trappist Monks of Belgium centuries ago, the staff created this beer using seven different malts, a traditional sugar, and their own Belgian yeast strain. The result was another unique yet balanced beer crafted in the classic Belgian style. To truly appreciate the classic styles and brewing traditions of Belgium, one must experience beer created in the classic Belgian package. This is why Allagash, after an extensive period of research, released their distinctive Reserve line of cork finished 750 ML bottles. This unique line employs the ancient tradition referred to as the méthode champenoise. The technique calls for two fermentations, one in the Brewery's fermenting tanks and the second in the bottle itself. It is this second fermentation that produces a notable increase in carbonation, a softer mouthfeel, and beers of remarkable complexity. This method of bottle conditioning leaves a small amount of yeast in the bottle, creating what is known as a living beer. As a result, these styles have a greatly enhanced shelf life and some styles will age exceptionally, much like a fine wine. Just as the styles originate in Belgium, so does the package itself. To insure authenticity, Allagash imports the bottles and corks directly from the same country that designed the techniques. This enables the beers to reach carbonation levels similar to champagne while allowing the corks to pop characteristically upon serving. Today, Allagash still remains one of very few breweries in North America using this distinctive package. From the very beginning, Allagash has strived to produce the finest Belgian-style and experimental ales this side of the Atlantic. It began as New England's original Belgian-Style brewery and has grown into one of the industry's most distinguished and well-respected brands. Following the time-tested brewing traditions of ancient Belgium, Allagash now produces a broad-ranging portfolio of artisanal beers with uncompromising quality.",

    "description": "Anchor Summer is the first American wheat beer in modern times. Our first brew of this light and refreshing beer was in the summer of 1984.\r\n\r\nAnchor Summer is an all-malt beer, and over 50% of its malt comes from malted wheat. It is fermented with a Triticum aestivum, AKA wheat traditional top-fermenting \"ale\" yeast because we prefer the clean flavors developed by this yeast. We believe that this style best celebrates the refreshingly light flavor of malted wheat. You may notice that the head on this beer is unusually abundant, with a consistency similar to whipped egg whites. This is due to protein contributed by the wheat.\r\n\r\nThe brewers at Anchor are proud to have revived not only rich hearty dark beers, but also this light crisp style of a modern American wheat beer.\r\n\r\nSummer getaway Wheat malt contributes to an unusual lightness and dryness to the palate, and this—combined with the distinctive flavor of the wheat—makes for a perfect thirst-quenching beverage. It is the ideal drink for beer lovers who appreciate tradition and character in their beer, but also seek a lighter, refreshing style, perfect for warm weather.\r\n\r\n-http://www.anchorbrewing.com/beers/summerbeer.htm",

It is virtually handmade by the brewers of Anchor Steam Beer in one of the smallest and most traditional breweries in the world. Liberty Ale is made with the finest barley malt, fresh, whole hops, top fermenting yeast, pure water and the simple natural methods which reflect our exceptional respect for the ancient art of brewing. It is \"dry hopped,\" a classic ale tradition, and slowly completes its fermentation in sealed vats in our cellars. This unique process creates Liberty Ale's distinctive bouquet and uncommonly delicate, entirely natural carbonation.",

    "description": "With its deep, dark brown-black color, thick, full-bodied, velvety-smooth mouth feel, mocha character, and, strong yet subtle hop bite,  Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout  is one of the thickest, richest, and most complex stouts on the market today. In 1990, it became our first gold medal winner, at the Great American Beer Festival.  Barney Flats  was judged so superior to the other stouts that no other medals were even awarded in its catagory. Try it and see why Stewart Kallen described it as, \"Slippery, creamy, dark, and sweet as a Pacific May morning,\" in his book,  The 50 Greatest Beers in the World\r\n\r\nBarney Flats Oatmeal Stout Most recently won the Silver Medal at the 2004 World Beer Cup® and the Bronze Medal at the 2004 GABF , as well as several other medals . Click the blue ribbon to see the entire list.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our products, Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout is never sterile filtered nor heat pasteurized, and should be stored in refrigeration. However, to fully enjoy its rich and complex flavor, it should be served between 40° and 45°F",

    "description": "Andy Hazen is a workhorse of a brewer. From start to finish, he is a one-man operation. The former cabinetmaker is also a self-reliant Mainer through and through. He was originally an all-grain homebrewer who decided to take it to the next level when his friends expressed interest in his beers. He designed the 12-barrel brewing system himself and enlisted a local welder to help put it together. Hazen notes that when you live in Maine, you have to find some service to provide to others in order to survive. For him, brewing is the service he provides to his local community. Located in the rolling hills of Lincolnville, Maine, Andrew's is housed in a renovated farmhouse next to Hazen's home. Finding the brewery is more than half the battle. Have no fear, however, as everyone knows about Andrew's. Also, be aware that due to some thieving souls, the brewery no longer has any signage to announce its existence to the visiting public. The only indication that a brewery exists in the farmhouse are the occasional keg deliveries in Hazen's front yard. And Hazen hasn't been quick to replace the sign either. While he welcomes visitors, you have to remember to clear a path for the busy brewer. Like many other unsung small brewers, running his 5OO-barrel per year brewery is a seven day a week operation for Hazen. Watching Hazen run the brewery is a little like watching Willy Wonka run the Chocolate Factory. When I visit him during a bottling day, Hazen runs between the bottling line and the packaging supplies in a hurried yet methodical manner. He stands up bottles on the line, starts the machine, slides his way across the brewhouse to the packaging materials, and hand assembles the six-packs that will hold the soon-to-be bottled beer. Andrew's beer is straightforward, unassuming and entirely enjoyable. His product line includes the St. Nick Porter, the Northern Brown Ale, the English Pale Ale, and the summer seasonal Ruby's Golden Ale. A celebration of the Amarillo hop, Hazen's English Pale Ale is a delightfully balanced product that neither over or underwhelms the palate.  from beerscribe.com",

In the spirit of old world tradition, our beers are sold and distributed by small independents (not national brands). Our beers are now available in select areas throughout the eastern US. We only brew 60 kegs per day, which allows us to still maintain our commitment to craftsmanship. The result is that our beers enjoy great respect in the beer community. Visit our Tasting Room for more information about our standard ales.  Our new facility was built on the site of an old farm a few miles from downtown Bar Harbor. It was designed to create a more visitor friendly environment similar to country wineries and breweries found throughout Europe.",

From humble beginnings, brewing 800 barrels of three different beers in 1994, we have progressed to brewing 13,000 barrels of twenty different beers in 2007. We attribute this success to beer drinkers gravitating to beers with more interesting flavor profiles. The unique flavor complexity of Avery beers occurs through a combination of sparing no expense with regard to ingredients and our hopping methods. Sparing no expense means using lots of specialty malts, imported hops, such as Styrian Goldings, and imported Belgian candy sugar.",

Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.",

    "description": "ndia Pale Ale is a style of beer that was developed in England during the period of the British Empire. It is derived from bitter ales but contains even more alcohol and hops. This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.\r\n\r\nBritish troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.\r\n\r\nAmerican home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.\r\n\r\nBig Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye. Its full hop flavor is guaranteed to please the palate of the true hop head.",

    "description": "The Calico Amber Ale was inspired by the beers of England. In England most of the beer is some kind of \"bitter\".  Bitter is a style that became popular in the late 1800's. The most famous examples are brewed in Burton on Trent.  This hard water gives these beer a pleasantly dry bitter finish, hence the name \"bitter.\"  A brewery usually brews several bitters of various alcohol strengths.  The lowest in alcohol (and usually flavor) is called \"bitter\" or \"ordinary bitter.\"  A step up in alcohol and hop character gives us \"best bitter\" or \"special bitter.\"  Finally a beer is made that is full of hop aroma and flavor, has a maltiness to match, and a generous amount of alcohol is called an \"extra special bitter\" or E.S.B.\r\n\r\nAlthough inspired by the British Ales  Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale uses distinctive American hops, which give not only the crisp bitterness to balance the malt, but also a hint of floral aroma. We brew Calico Amber Ale with 100% malt and use 4 different malts to give it a rich complexity.  The blend of crystal  malts give it flavors including toffee and caramel.  A blend of American Cascade and Centennial hops provide a counterpoint to the malt.  Finally our proprietary yeast provides a fruity background and a Madeira like richness that rounds out this gold medal winning ale.",

Founded in 1992, the Mart continues to be a catalyst for the San Diego brewing scene, setting the trend for handcrafted ales. Inspired by our customers, employees and brewers, the Sculpin IPA is bright with aromas of apricot, peach, mango and lemon. Its lighter body also brings out the crispness of the hops. This delicious Ballast Point Ale took a Bronze Medal at the 2007 Great American Beer Festival in the Pro Am category. The Sculpin fish has poisonous spikes on its fins that can give a strong sting. Ironically, the meat from a Sculpin is considered some of the most tasty. Something that has a sting but tastes great, sounds like a Ballast Point India Pale Ale.",

    "description": "Ballast Point Wahoo Wheat Beer is created using the same ingredients that were once used in Belgium. Flaked unmalted wheat, oats and malted barley comprise the grain. The unmalted wheat has a high protein content, which causes the beer to be hazy, thus giving it a cloudy, or \"white\" appearance. A special yeast gives a refreshing tangy flavor that is different from both the sour Weiss beers of Berlin or the banana and clovey Weizens of Bavaria. The mild hopping allows the unique malts to show through and does not conflict with the subtleties of the citrus spicing. This unique citrus character is created by adding a blend of curacao (bitter orange), sweet orange and coriander to the boil. White beers are light and refreshing, yet provide a complex reminder that interesting high quality beer does not have to be bitter and dark. Ballast Point Wahoo Wheat Beer is the perfect beer for sunny San Diego.",

Production first occurred in Germany prior to any in America.  The Raven was originally produced in the Black Forest and still is produced in the Black Forest region of Baden-Württemberg. The small town of Nagold, south of Stuttgart and west of the university town of Tübingen, is where the Anker Brewery can be found.   BWBW was founded by Stephen Demczuk of Baltimore, who was partner in Europe's first beer-of-the-month club, Beer Around the World. He, along with Baltimorean, Jim Seay and German beer importer Mr. Wolfgang Stark, styled a beer that would be appealing to the masses, drinkable and enjoyed by both the lager and ale drinker. From the assistance of master brewer Mr. Hans-Martin Walz of Anker Brewery, came The Raven, a beer brewed in honor of Baltimore's literary genius, Edgar Allan Poe. After more than a year operating in Europe, the world's most competitive beer market, production of The Raven began in Baltimore in June of 1998.",

    "description": "Mike Baker and Jeff Smiley founded Baron Brewing in the beginning of 2003. A brewery has been in the works for sometime. Lots of discussions on what if we had a brewery were had, over lots of good German beer. The opportunity came for us to travel to Germany to really get involved with the German brewing process and ideology - as well as sample the best beer on earth. After that trip, the direction of the brewery was set. German beer had to be re-discovered by the population. After many discussions on opening a brewery and a trip to Germany, the dream became reality. We found an existing brewery to purchase - Lunar Brewing. After purchasing Lunar and getting approved for all the necessary licensing, Baron is ready to go. On June 14th, the world of Seattle will have the chance to finally taste and purchase Baron Beer. The first style of many to be released is our flagship beer - Munich Lager.That is all for the history. We are growing on a daily basis and plan to be around for quite some time.",

    "description": "Established as a brewpub in 1995 in the historic Over-The-Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company has since transitioned into a regionally distributed microbrewery offering an impressive selection of both innovative styles of ales and traditional lagers. Brewed and bottled in small batches with only honest ingredients, BarrelHouse beers are extremely fresh and exceptionally flavorful. Thank you for embracing our fiercely independent vision of a hand-crafted future for all! Operating as a brewpub from August 1995 until February 2005, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company recently relocated to our current location in the West End of downtown Cincinnati. We officially reopened with a completed expansion plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals 31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently flavorful product. While our brewing process is quite labor intensive, we believe that hand-crafting our beers sets us apart from the majority of breweries in the U.S. today. Our dedication is unparalleled and quite evident in the final packaged product.",

    "description": "Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is Williamsport's first production brewery since the 1950's. The brewery, which occupies 9,000 square feet at 429 W. 3rd St in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, was founded by Mike Hiller in July 2007.  Though a native of South Williamsport, Barbarian Chief, Mike Hiller, first entered the craft brewing industry in 1997 as an Account Services Associate for Legendary Distributors, Ltd., of Richmond, Virginia. After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife, Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the recipes for Hammerin' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment's balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian's logo and label designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business plans. Thanks to the support of family, friends and other area businessmen who believed in Mike's dream, Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is now a reality.",

With moving there, the brewingcapacity greatly enhanced due to new brewing-, fermenting- and lagerfacilities. Christoffel brews according to the German Reinheitsgebot von 1516: which means the brewingprocess takes place in a completely natural way.

    "description": "Black Creek Historic Brewery recreates the techniques, tools and recipes used by brewers in 1860s Ontario. Our Brewmasters do everything by hand on a small scale. It's a great place to learn about beer because, unlike a modern commercial brewery, you can see every step in the process for yourself. And, no one else has a Brewmaster ready to welcome visitors in period costume.\n\nIn the 1860s there were 155 registered breweries in Ontario, and countless smaller operations. Black Creek Historic Brewery is the first in this province to replicate the brewing processes of that era, when there was no electricity or refrigeration, no stainless steel tanks or bottling plants.\n\nThe equipment at Black Creek Historic Brewery is made mainly of wood and copper, and the beer ferments the way it was done in the old days, with wooden barrels to age the beer. Malted barley is shoveled by hand into the wort tun where it is boiled into a mash. After filtering the solids through a linen cloth, the sugary liquid is boiled and hops are added, both for flavouring and as a natural preservative. Once the boiling is complete, the beer is put in barrels where the yeast is added. A short time later, the beer is ready!\n\nVisitors can sample the beer at cellar temperature, the way it was enjoyed in the past, or drink a chilled pint in the pub, the way many people prefer it today. Either way, you",

Its name probably originates in the belief that this strong, nourishing drink was ideal for hard-working porters and labourers. Black Creek Porter is wonderful on its own, or with salty snacks.\n\n",

    "description": "Samuel Adams Boston Lager® is the best example of the fundamental characteristics of a great beer, offering a full, rich flavor that is both balanced and complex. It is brewed using a decoction mash, a time consuming, traditional four vessel brewing process discarded by many contemporary brewers. This process brings forth a rich sweetness from the malt that makes it well worth the effort. Samuel Adams Boston Lager® also uses only the finest of ingredients including two row barley, as well as German Noble aroma hops. The exclusive use of two row barley not only imparts a full, smooth body but also gives the beer a wide spectrum of malt flavor ranging from slightly sweet to caramel to slightly roasted. The Noble hops varieties, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger, add a wide range of floral, piney and citrus notes, which are present from the aroma, through the flavor, to the lingering smooth finish. We take great pride in the Noble hops used in our beers. They are hand selected by Jim Koch and our other brewers from the world's oldest hops growing area. Among the world's most expensive, they cost twenty times as much as other hops.",

We’re calling it an India Brown Ale to help illustrate its flavor to the consumer. It’s hoppy like an IPA but dark and roasty like a Brown Ale. Put them together and voila! Flashback at its finest!",

In order to obtain grapes which are as mature as possible, we buy them at the end of the season. Every year, 1000 kilos of white italian grapes are delivered at the Cantillon brewery in the beginning of October.",

Top-fermented and bottle-conditioned, this is a clean, refreshing regional 'artisan' beer.\r\nPresents a light hazy yellow colour with citrus and coriander aromas and fairly subtle malt and hops on the palate. The finish is dry and satisfying. Hazy yellow golden colour. Lemon custard, lime zest, and delicate spice melange aromas. Well-balanced, a frothy entry leads to a dryish medium body of nuts, baked oranges, and slightly phenolic mineral flavors. Finishes with a metallic ore dust, salt, and dried lemon fade. This beer is certified as organic.",

It was originally brewed as a winter ale under the name Tournay de Noel, but later became a year-round release.  They didn't provide much specific detail about how it was brewed except to say that it is made with water, malts, candi-sugar, hops, and yeast.  It is 7.6% ABV with a recommended drinking temperature of +/- 50 degrees.  The brewer states that the tasting notes are of, \"roasted malts, coffee, bitter chocolate, earth, and cigar ash.\"  Well, I am a prodigious cigar smoker and I can't say that I would want to consume the ash.",

Combined with traditional malt\r\nsweetness is a distinct smoke flavor derived from authentic peat-smoked malt. This beer will change your opinion about Scottish ales due to its drinkability. Hop flavor and bitterness are minor, yet balance out this malty beer.\r\n\r\nBrau Scotch Ale is copper to amber in color with an off-white head of tightly laced bubbles. Wide-bowled glassware will allow the sweet and smoky aroma to escape. This ale can be served from 34- 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Lower temps will make it easier to drink while higher temps will enhance both malt and hop flavor. Portion control is important as this beer.",

It has a big sweet mouthfeel, followed by more hoppiness than you've ever had at one time. Enjoy.",

Our brewery is a modern, 15-barrel brew house capable of making up to 3,000 barrels of beer per year. I an make ales or lagers, but mostly it has been ales, which tend to have a more complex flavor profile.  I can use a simple one step infusion mash, or more elaborate multi-temperature steps.",

This is difficult for modern style wiennies to grasp. How can one style be so many things? How can I judge it good or bad?.

Many people, however, don't realize that there are different varieties of \"Guinness\" brewed around the world. \"Draught Guinness* and \"Foreign Extra Stout\" are the two primary types brewed in Ireland. Foreign Extra is the one I have emulated. It is closer in style to the London Porters of old than to modern stout. Very dark and rich, not as dry as Draught, about 6% abv and around 60 IBUs (that's hop bitterness). I used \"First Gold\" hops because that's what I could get. Guinness use Nitrogen mixed with carbon dioxide to dispense their stout which adds to the creamy mouth-feel. BTW: The \"Imported\" Guinness you buy here in the US comes from Canada. It could just as well be brewed in the US but the common wisdom in the brewing world is that Americans prefer \"imported\" beers and will pay more for them.",

To create this beer, we use the old technique of 100% bottle re-fermentation, a practice now rare even in Europe. It gives this beer a palate of unusual depth. Enjoy it locally or globally, as an aperitif or with your favorite dishes. It is particularly nice with spicy seafood and with fine cheeses.",

The pale wood of the glass holder makes a pleasant contrast with the beer.\r\n\r\nSMELL:\r\nYou will smell a mellow, fruity and malty aroma with a slightly spicy character (coriander, hops). Additional earthy and very subtle aromas of banana and perhaps also a whiff of pineapple or mango in the background.\r\n\r\nTASTE:\r\nDiscover a very mellow, fruity attack, a nougat-like solidity, and a slightly spicy character with hints of liquorice passing into a warm finish that reminds you of caramelised banana. The bitterness always remains in the background but in the end emerges delicately.",

Hints of vanilla mixed with citrus aromas.\r\n\r\nTASTE:\r\nTripel Karmeliet has not only the lightness and freshness of wheat, but also the creaminess of oats together with a spicy lemony almost quinine\r\ndryness.",

Aging time is limited due to the fact that hop bitterness is declining with the time. Store arabier cool and dark and serve cool at 10°C. Cheers!",

Around the world, the group is considered to be the leading producer of blond, bottle conditioned, high fermentation beers, a dominant position owed largely to the success of its best-selling product Duvel. A niche player, Duvel Moortgat occupies a leading position in the strategic segments of speciality beers and premium brands like Duvel, Maredsous, Bel Pils and Vedett. The group markets Steendonk white beer in a joint venture with the Palm brewery. Duvel Moortgat has also entered the market of natural fruit juices with a 70% participation in the quality juice producer Freya. Today, the group's beers are exported to over 40 countries. Duvel Moortgat has also taken a firm foothold in Central Europe, thanks to a 50% participation in the Czech Bernard brewery, renowned for its premium Pilsners. The group has launched itself into the market of artisan premium beers through the acquisition of the American Ommegang brewery. Duvel Moortgat has also been listed on the Brussels Euronext stock exchange since 1999.",

    "description": "In 1963, the Benedictine abbey of Maredsous entrusted the production and sales of the famed Maredsous beers to Duvel Moortgat. The monks continue to exercise strict control over its recipes and quality standards right up to today.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegardless of what colour or taste you choose, the Maredsous range has everything to intrigue you. These aromatic, delicate, fruity and velvety beers supplement each other in a perfect harmony as far as both colour and taste experience are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe blonde Maredsous with 6% alcohol content, the brown one with 8% alcohol content and the triple one with 10% alcohol content ripen first for two full months before they depart to their final destination. The specific bottle fermentation, refined by the brewery for its main brand Duvel, also give the Maredsous abbey beers an extra dimension. \t \r\n\r\nAbout Maredsous\r\n\r\nThe triple Maredsous with 10% alcohol content is one of the favourite beers of Michael Jackson, the outstanding beer ’pope’:\r\n\"These beers have long been my favourites. Above all the 10° is an especially tasty beer.\"",

These hops were fractioned at several times in the cooking process in order to keep a maximum of aroma.\r\n\r\nRegarding to taste we can say that the beer has a gentle, but nevertheless bitter aftertaste. Gold-yellow colour. Hoppy aroma.",

    "description": "Hoegaarden is the authentic Belgian wheat or white beer. It has a unique and extremely complex brewing process whereby the brand is first top fermented and then is refermented within the bottle - ending up in a unique cloudy-white appearance. The brand's unique appearance is mirrored by its one-of-a-kind taste - sweet and sour beer with a little bitterness, slightly spicy, with a strong touch of coriander and a hint of orange, perfect for warm summer days, instead of other refreshing beverages. Refreshing, a little quirky, and decidedly different - naturally.",

    "description": "Gulden Draak is a beer in a class of its own. It is a beer that is rich and glowing, so full of its very own characteristic flavour, that it reminds some who try it of chocolate and others of coffee. In 1998 Gulden Draak was crowned “best beer in the world” by the American Tasting Institute! This beer has won many other awards too. Gulden Draak is named for the golden statue at the top of the clock tower of the Belgian city of Gent. The statue was originally given to the city of Constantinople by the Norse King Sigrid Magnusson in 1111, during the crusades; hence the form of a Viking ship that the beast was given. During a later crusade, Boudewijn IX (Count of Flanders and Emperor of Constantinople) took it back to Flanders with him because it was so beautiful. In 1382, the cities of Brugge and Gent did battle for the statue. Gent won.",

    "description": "This beauty is a complete work of art! Bryan and I picked 22 lbs of fresh Cascade hops from 3 gigantic hop vines Bryan has at his house. Hops produce an overabundance of hop cones and we were there for the picking. Even after 22 lbs, we hardly put a dent in the yield! So...here we are 3 weeks later, the beer is on tap and it is the freshest...hoppiest...flavorful beer you can imagine! Needless to say, we are proud of this beauty from the ground, up! We wanted a full-flavored IPA, so Bryan suggested we use our Requiem IPA recipe, and calculate for fresh, whole hop cones. Worked beautifully!! We ended up with an IPA with so much up-front flavor you would think you are enjoying a high octane Imperial! Instead, this is a middle-of-the-road IPA, at 5.2% abv!! This just goes to show how a hugely flavorful IPA can be loaded-up with fresh ingredients and come out the other end, a tasty LOW octane, treat! Bryan and I hope you get to stop in soon to try this one out! We decorated Bube's with some of the actual hop vines we pulled from. For the true hophead, you will be in heaven. And for the all-around beer enthusiasts, we hope you can appreciate the creativity in this beer. I know I'm proud to say I had a hand in this one!!",

    "description": "Carver Brothers Bakery first opened on June 1, 1983, in Winter Park, Colorado. It started with Jim, Bill, Sara and Eleanor Carver. In 1986 Jim, Bill and Barb Wynne opened Carvers Bakery / Café in Durango and the Winter Park Bakery was sold.   In 1988 Carvers opened the brewery  making it the first brewery in the four corners region since prohibition. Although still known affectionately by the locals as Carvers, Carvers then became Carver Brewing Company.  Since then Carvers has seen many exciting changes: opening it's outdoor Beer Garden in 1994 and undergoing dramatic remodels in the restaurant and on the patio in '98 and '02. In April of '07 it was deemed necessary to expand the brewery.  The brewery is now housed in the area previously occupied by the bakery.  After 20 years of serving Colorado's mountain folk, Carvers continues to provide the very best in food and beer.",

    "description": "The Catawba Valley Brewing Company grew out of a simple gift, and the love of good beer.  A beginner's home brewing kit given years ago began a passion for brewing that could only culminate with production on a larger scale.  It seemed natural to take production from a few gallons to a few barrels and beyond. During the summer of 1999 the business that is now Catawba Valley Brewing Company was born.\n\nIn April of 2007 the brewery relocated from Glen Alpine, NC to downtown Morganton, NC.  In the process we didn't lose a customer or miss a delivery.  In fact we achieved record spring sales.  In addition to relocating we've also opened our taproom to the public.  We encourage those interested in finely crafted beers to stop by and try our selection of beers.  Getting a fresher beer is a near impossibility.",

Our IPA uses 6 different hop varietals, with Simcoe hops only being used for dry hopping. The rest of the hop additions are blended at different IBU's (International Bittering Units) in groups of three hops per addition in order to create more hop complexity. At CCB, we love hops but also feel that balance is important for IPAs. So Jai Alai features a sturday caramel malt component which helps to create balance, staving off hop astringency. Ultimately, Jai Alai is a very strong interpretation of a single American IPA. We hope that it makes Tampa Bay natives happy because this is head brewer Wayne Wamble's favorite Cigar City beer and he'd love to share one with you!",

Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste. Our goal is to brew beers for people who dare to walk up to the edge of the mountain and actually jump forward.  Our beers are for those who chart a bolder course.   Our brewery is named for the famed Clipper ship - first developed and built in our home port of Baltimore. The Clipper ship is the symbol for a strong nautical and maritime heritage with a commitment to craftsmanship of the highest caliber. It captures both the hardy nature of our working class history and the romance of what lies on the seas ahead. Why be normal when you can be EXTRAARGHdinary?  We believe in bringing beer drinkers the quality and flavor of a handcrafted beer while supporting the local communities we serve.",

There are certain pure elements in the water that are absolutely perfect for brewing world class beers.

    "description": "Copper Kettle Brewery is an up and coming brewery owned by Harold Kerlin and Russ Eisenhuth. We have been independently brewing beer for the past 6 years. In 2006 we won First place in the Sam Adams Longshot contest for the northeast region of the U.S. with our Potbelly Porter. After that we decided to start our own brewery. The Brewery is located in just outside of Laurelton PA. We are a small production brewery using a one barrel brewing system. We hope to produce around 50 barrels a year. At present we are making 4 different styles of beer. A Wheat beer, Porter, Grand Cru, and Belgian Dubbel. All of our beer is unfiltered, and bottle conditioned. Our beers are now available at the Bull Run Inn, Market St., Lewisburg, The Beer Barn, Lewisburg and Wehr's Beverages, Mifflinburg.",

Finally, curious beer drinkers are stepping out from under the mind-numbing barrage of large brewery advertising and deciding for themselves what they like. Our beers are designed for those curious drinkers. The large breweries use fillers in their beer; Corn or Rice are the most frequently used. Most good beer should be all Barley, in the same way that good hamburgers are all beef. Barley is expensive and the more fillers that are used, the better the profits! Cricket Hill Beers are 100% Barley as are most great beers. Please take the time to taste different local beers. I am certain that those who decide not to let television dictate what they drink are ready for a wonderful adventure into the world of Beer!",

Although this beer is as cool as \"the Fonz\"  when first purchased, it gets really mellow and smooth with some age. After a year or two stored in a cool dark place you'll notice the heavy caramel and malt flavors are trying to sneak past the hops, they’re just not fast enough.

    "description": "HOP HENGE IMPERIAL IPA – The Ultimate in Hop Innovation \r\n\r\nHop Henge Imperial IPA returns to the Bond Street Series line-up this April in extreme fashion. Staying true to the experimental nature of the series and the “never settle” philosophy of Deschutes, our brewers went back to the drawing board to create an amplified version of last year’s monument to hops.\r\n\r\nHead Brewer Brett Porter says, “This is a truly exciting and groundbreaking beer. We reformulated everything about the hop recipe to give Hop Henge an extraordinary aroma and flavor similar to a fresh hop beer.” In addition to the Cascade and Centennial hops, Deschutes Brewery is experimenting with a hop variety so new that it has yet to be named.\r\n\r\nThe team here at Bend Public House recommends Hop Henge as the perfect accompaniment for a variety of spicy foods, so be sure to have a bottle handy next time you make a batch of hot wings and go for the five alarm award. The high-octane hoppiness is a wildly refreshing antidote to a wide array of hot foods.\r\n\r\nLimited Availability April through June.\r\n\r\nDon’t miss this amazing hop experiment that is sure to leave your taste buds begging for more.\r\n\r\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/Brews/Bond+Street+Series/default.aspx\r\n\r\nAvailable April through June.\r\n\r\nHop Henge I.P.A. was first brewed in 2006 as an agressive West Coast style I.P.A. In 2007, Hop Henge is going Imperial!  Several pounds of  Centennial, Cascade and Northern Brewer hops are in each barrel with a heavy dry-hop presence to top it off.  A blend of crystal, pale and caraston malts creates an overall biscuity characteristic that is dense and muscular, building the alcohol base to support the monstrous hop profile.\r\n\r\nLike the rest of the Bond Street Series, Hop Henge highlights the creativity and curiosity of our brewers.  Bolder than its English ancestors, with huge hops and a bitter finish, this IPA is no wallflower.\r\n\r\nAlcohol By Volume: 8.1%\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIBU 95\r\n\r\nWhen one of our brewers suggested we name our new IPA Hop Henge, he also came up with the idea of actually recreating Stonehenge, only with hop bales.  We were up for the challenge and even though the weather did not want to cooperate, we pulled it off and threw a party afterwards.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nphoto: chris mather\r\nRatings, Awards & Notables\r\n\r\nWorld's Best Strong Pale Ale (Imperial IPA)\r\n2007 World Beer Awards\r\n\r\nWorld's 50 Best Beers\r\n2006 International Beer Challenge\r\n\r\nGold Medal, 92 Points\r\n2006 World Beer Championships\r\n\r\nSilver Medal, India Pale Ale Category\r\n2006 Australian International Beer Awards\r\n\r\nModern Brewery Age, February 12, 2007\r\n5 out 5 stars \r\nHop Henge started its life as an India Pale Ale, but this year it was bumped up to “Imperial IPA” status, with a hefty dose of additional hops.\r\n“This one is lovely,” said taster Tom Conti. “They got it just right.”\r\nIt pours out a deep amber, with an appealing rocky head, and rich hop aroma wafting from the glass. “They sure dosed it with a lot of hops...[there’s] a lot of hop bitterness in the taste,” one taster observed.\r\nIn addition to the Imperial-level hopping, Hop Henge also boasts Imperial-level alcohol content, with 8.1% a.b.v.\r\nThis was the top-rated beer during its tasting session, and tasters had to dig deep for new superlatives to describe it. “This is a beautiful beer,” concluded taster Gregg Glaser. “Full of flavor and hops and malt and hops again.”\r\n“Not for the timid,” said taster Robert Lachman.\r\n\r\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/BrewPub/OnTap/125352.aspx",

    "description": "This Fresh Hop Pale Ale is all about celebrating the hop harvest in the fall.  Fresh picked hops have to be added to the brew immediately and in abundance.  Roughly 270 pounds of Crystal hops from Doug Weathers' farm outside Salem, Oregon will be added to the 50 barrel batch in addition to some dry kilned whole flower hops.  That adds up to approximately 5.5 pounds of hops per barrel brewed.  Another deliciously interesting beer in our Bond Street Series.",

    "description": "After several months of experimentation, energy and obsession, Deschutes Brewery’s brewers have triumphed once again.  Inversion I.P.A.'s trio of American hops delivers an over-the-top nose with hints of orange and grapefruit.  Inversion is then dry-hopped for seven days resulting in an added hoppy kick.  To balance the hop character, Deschutes’ brewers used crystal and caraston malts that weave throughout the beer providing soft, complex caramel flavors. \r\n\r\nJust like clear days up on the mountain, Inversion I.P.A. will deliver a path to higher ground.  Inversion I.P.A. is a phenomenal NW-style I.P.A., beckoning all beer drinkers and enticing I.P.A. lovers to invert their world and find clarity above the routine of the everyday.",

True Pilsners are the most difficult to brew as there are no dark malts or flavorings used to mask flaws. Pilsner is the best known style of beer in the world. A good pilsner balances hops and malts to a refreshing, clean tasting, every-mood kind of beer. The Bohemian can stand alone or join a party easily.",

    "description": "Geno and Cindy Acevedo founded El Toro Brewing Company in the summer of 1992. After much planning, research and construction business was begun in March of 1994. The brewery is a small 17-barrel (527 gallon) batch system and operates on the Acevedo's rural residential property.  Within seven months of opening El Toro Brewing Company received its first national recognition at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival (GABF). One of its flagships El Toro Oro Golden Ale won a coveted Gold Medal for English Pale Ale. At the 1996 GABF Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, the brewery's other flagship beer, won a Silver Medal for English Brown Ale. It is a mild yet robust brown ale. The 1997 GABF saw El Toro garner another Gold Medal for the American styled wheat beer named after the brewer's father-in-law, William Jones Wheat Beer.  After 16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with patio. Inside is the world's only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the back of the large mirrored bar you will find over 25 beers and handcrafted sodas on tap. We also have a gleaming copper Pub Brewing system 3 BBL (100 gallon) brewery. Live music and dancing will also be a regular nighttime happening at the brewpub consisting of mostly local bands playing cover type and original Rock, Blues, Jazz and Reggae.",

With over 12 years brewing experience under his belt, founding the brewery operations at Long Valley Pub & Brewery in New Jersey and resurrecting Time Square Brewery in Manhatten, Brewer Tim brings a good sense of what beers people enjoy drinking to Elk Creek Aleworks.  Winning Gold and Bronze medals for his Porter and Bitter at the prestigous Great American Beer Festival attests to the fact that his peers also think he makes great beer. Drawing inspiration primarily from traditional English ale brewing, Tim makes balanced beers, giving both malt and hops prominence in every pint.  In addition to our rotating selection of seasonal brews, we offer six outstanding House Standards year 'round.  Without doubt, there's a pint for you!",

One extended visit to our fermenter left the engineer in a rather befuddled state of mind. On his fateful trip out of Erie that evening, his train mysteriously derailed. The engineer swears that a huge black cherry tree had fallen across the tracks as the culprit. No such tree was ever found, but the front of the locomotive was spattered with hundreds of red sports. In tribute to this folklore our expert brewers introduce Derailed Black Cherry Ale – brewed with fresh sweet black cherries and the finest malted barley to create a truly cherrylicious ale. Please enjoy responsibly, as we would never want you to get derailed!",

In the fall of 1994, Gordon Knight decided to sell his half of the business. When Gordon left, Eric Bratrud took over as the head Brewer. The Brewery also expanded to a 14 BBL Brewhouse and moved out onto the main floor where is now located. In 1995 we started packaging our beers in 12 oz bottles, which expanded our market. By this time we had added a number of beers including Trail Ridge Red, Estes Park Gold, Stinger Wild Honey Wheat and Samson Stout. 1995 was also the first year of the Best of the West Brewfest held in the Brewery parking lot. Since '95 we've continued to evolve both in our restaurant and with our brewing operations. In 2003 Tyler Lemirande and Eric Bratrud took over as owners.",

    "description": "Everyone has their price. For some, it's measured in dollars per hour, for others it's powder days. For those that have the gift of passion for the dark side, it's measured in pints of Oatmeal Stout. Another one of FiftyFifty's seasonals, the Roundabout Oatmeal Stout is brown to black in color and nearly opaque. It has a velvet like mouthfeel, moderate hints of dark dried fruit, espresso beans and Dark Chocolate... and just a hint of hop bitterness. The addition of Flaked Oats gives this brew its wonderful creamy texture. Roundabout Oatmeal Stout is one of a series of Stouts that FiftyFifty Brewing Co. will produce during the course of the year. Enjoy!",

Furthermore, Truckee has no Trappist Monastery and that, my friend, is why we at FiftyFifty bring you Trifecta. This is one of FiftyFifty's seasonal ales, and is a high alcohol Belgian style beer. Brewed with inspiration from Belgian Trappist Ales, Trifecta also includes locally grown Purple Sage Honey. With a complex spiciness tempered by the sweeter notes from the sage honey, flavors of spicy sage, alcohol, and mild malt sweetness are apparent, and sage and clove like aromas predominate. Coming in at over 8%, this beer is deceptively strong.",

And we knew it was going to take hard work, unwavering passion, and even a little magic along the way to make it a sustainable effort.\n\nWhat a journey it's been.\n\nFINNEGANS Irish Amber is now sold throughout Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota. Since first being profitable in 2003, we have donated over $150,000 to the FINNEGANS Community Fund, which in turn has given grants to non-profits across the Midwest to support life-changing programs for the working poor. We plan to roll out a new FINNEGANS product in 2011, and eventually have an entire line of FINNEGANS branded products",

    "description": "After years of careful planning  and mortgaging everything  the Flat Earth Brewing Company was brought to life in 2007 by head brewer Jeff Williamson and his wife Cathie. In search of a calmer life and an even better beer, Jeff turned his passion for brewing into a career. After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.",

    "description": "When Gene Muller founded Flying Fish Brewing Co. in 1995, he did so first on the World Wide Web - making it the world's first virtual microbrewery. That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site This Old House meets the World Wide Web�letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.  He also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers. Muller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order). Flying Fish Brewing Company is located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state. Head brewer Casey Hughes now produces four full-time styles, as well as a variety of seasonal beers.   The key word to describe all Flying Fish beers is balance. The beers are full-flavored, yet highly drinkable. Flavors harmonize, not fight for individual attention. Hopping is generous, but to style. Seeing beer as equal to, if not superior to, wine, Flying Fish beers are designed to complement food. Because of this effort, one can walk into any fine restaurant in the Philadelphia region and be pretty sure of finding a Flying Fish beer available. Flying Fish beers were the first in the region to be featured at the Great British Beer Festival, Oregon Brewers Festival and Canada's Biere de Mondial Festival. They have also won several medals at the Real Ale Festival in Chicago, the World Beer Championships and is the only New Jersey brewery featured in the 2000 book Best American Beers.",

    "description": "Belgian Wits originated in Belgium, in the area of Brabant just east of Brussels. This are was a part of the Netherlands in the early 1800's and was the wheat growing region. In this era, the Dutch basically controlled the spice trade, thus, coriander as well as Curacao orange peel made its way into the beer. Spices were used well before the widespread use of hops in beer. At one point there were more than thirty breweries producing a Wit, but overtime the style died off and in 1954 the last of the breweries ceased operations. One of the most famous brands of Belgian Wits is Hoegaarden (pronounced \"Who Garden\") produced by Pierre Celis back in 1966. This revived the style and by the 1980's it was popular again!\r\n\r\nBelgian Wits are similar to a Hefeweizen with respect to the cloudiness of the beer and some phenolic (clove) and tart flavors. Wits should have white, rocky head when poured and should be almost white in appearance, hence the name. \r\n\r\nYou will smell oranges and coriander which is different than a Hefeweizen that smells of banana and clove. Our version of a Belgian Wit is called \"Hoof - Hearted Wit,\" and it is brewed to style with dried bitter and sweet orange peel and coriander seeds.",

Black Betty has 5% alc/vol and a smooth character that marks most lager beers.\r\n\r\nThe name, of course, comes from the Huddy Ledbetter song from the 1940’s which was made popular by the band Ram Jam and later by the Black Crows and U2, among others.",

The potential of the beer was soon realised and ESB was installed as a permanent fixture, creating an immediate impact. \r\n\r\nNot only was it one of the strongest regularly brewed draught beers in the country (at 5.5% ABV), it was also one of the tastiest, and as the awareness of the beer grew, so did its popularity. ESB's reputation was soon enhanced after being named CAMRA's (Campaign for Real Ale) Beer of the Year in 1978, and the beer has not stopped winning since! \r\n\r\nWith three CAMRA Beer of the Year awards, two World Champion Beer awards, and numerous other gold medals to speak of, ESB is, quite simply, the Champion Ale.",

The styles are (1) Black Beer (aka schwartzbier) originating from the former East Germany); (2) Rye Beer which at one time was only made in hardier areas of Eastern and Baltic Europe; and (3) Bock Beer which is widely known as a higher alcohol lager of Northern Germany. Our Black Rye Bock has a distinctive bitter chocolate palate and black color reminiscent of a black beer. The spiciness from the rye malt shines through in the flavor. The high alcohol balanced with malty sweetness rounds out this cold season bock. Smooth drinking with a punch makes this lager a perfect quaffer for our Arctic winter. 6.2% alcohol by volume.",

Nine years ago, we began our quest to provide beer lovers with a worthy fruit beer, by rolling out Wild Raspberry Ale. Our mantra is that real fruit makes real beer, so we ferment Wild Raspberry Ale with hundreds of pounds of real red and black raspberries. We steadfastly refuse to fall prey to extracts and cheap syrups. Sure, squirting syrup into a keg of beer and rolling it around on the floor is easy, but the taste is...  fake! Over the past nine years, we have stayed true to our commitment to real fruit, no matter what the time, expense, or late season frosts have thrown our way. One year, Mother Nature delivered a late cold snap that was so severe, we had to pre-order 85% of the harvestable U.S. black raspberry crop, just to meet the demand for Wild Raspberry Ale.\r\n\r\nOur efforts do not go unrewarded – Wild Raspberry Ale is a truly effervescent, ruby red ale that achieves the almost impossible balance between malted barley and tart raspberry fruitiness. Its naturally tart character makes Wild Raspberry the ultimate accompaniment to spicy Mexican food or on its own as a stand-alone session beer.",

It has been identified as one of the few surviving examples of Vienna style lager - a style that was largely replaced in European breweries with Oktoberfest, a slightly lighter lager, in the early twentieth century. \r\nNegra Modelo pours with an off-white, medium head. The body is clear with a rich amber/copper color. The aroma is sweet with hints of apple. The impression at the first sip is sweet. This gives way only a bit to some hops bitterness which gives some balance but leaves the beer firmly in the sweet category. It has no real lager snap at the end, just lingering hops. This actually makes the second sip more balanced than the first.\r\n\r\nThere is some complexity and depth here but the flavors are very delicate. They are obliterated by the aggressive flavors of the Mexican food that Modelo is often served with making it a sweet balance to the savory and sometimes hot cuisine.",

This India Pale Ale is unabashedly hoppy, not only from the Amarillo hops we add to the brew kettle, but also from the northwest U.S. variety called Cascade that we add directly to the final tank. A firm toasted malt presence forms the background for all of these hops, and we're confident our Little Scrapper IPA could take other so-called IPA's to the mat if called upon to do so. Try it with a curry or a basket of beer battered fish & chips. Serve in a glass at 8 degrees celcius. Unpasturized.",

    "description": "For the 28th session of the Harpoon 100 Barrel Series, we’re celebrating this year’s hop harvest with Glacier Harvest Wet Hop beer, a pale ale made with fresh Glacier hops.\r\n \r\nWet hop beers are brewed using fresh, “wet” hops instead of traditional dried hops—hops contain about 60% moisture when they are first picked.\r\n\r\nTypically, when hops are picked they are quickly dried and refrigerated to increase shelf life and make them more consistent for brewing. Freshly picked wet hops, however, need to be used within hours of harvest or they will begin to degrade rapidly. Wet hops retain more of their natural aroma and volatile flavors that dissipate when dried. This gives wet hop beers a fresher hop flavor and aroma than that of beers hopped with processed hops.\r\nThis yields an immersed, intense hop flavor in the beer.\r\n\r\nHarpoon brewer Ray Dobens, creator of the beer, added a heroic dose of fresh hops the day of the harvest.The hop flavor and aroma from this copper-colored ale comes from a generous late addition of freshly harvested “wet” hops.",

The blend of these malts produces a beer that is complex and delicious without being heavy. This drinkable beer is perfect as a session beer or paired with foods.\r\n\r\nThis is the first year-round Harpoon beer the brewery has released in almost a decade.  While the craft beer industry has seen a growing trend in \"extreme\" beers, the brewers of Harpoon wanted to create something they could sit down and enjoy over an extended period of time - a session beer.  At 4.3% alcohol by volume, the Harpoon Brown Ale has the lowest alcohol content of all Harpoon beers.\r\n\r\nHarpoon Brown Ale will be available in bottles and on draft beginning in March 2007.  An evening of celebrations to toast the beer's release will be held at locations throughout New England on Thursday, March 8th, including tastings at Harpoon's breweries in Boston, MA and Windsor, VT",

Perhaps UFO’s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head.  The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO.  Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing.  When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.\r\n\r\nThe aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character.  This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon.  The lemon accentuates the yeast’s fruity, tart fragrance.  UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body.  The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor.  UFO has a clean finish.  Unlike some imported hefeweizens, UFO does not have the spicy, tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.\r\n\r\nThe overall character is a cloudy appearance with a citrus-like aroma, light body, and clean finish.

It was designed to be enjoyed during the holiday season. \r\n\r\nWhen you bring a glass of this dark copper ale to your lips to take your first sip you will notice the aroma of cinnamon.  There is no aromatic hop added that might overpower the distinct spice scent.  The medium body of this beer is formed from caramel and pale malts.  These create enough body to support the spices without making the beer excessively rich.  Bittering hops are added to counter the sweetness of the malt and spice.  The finish of the beer is a blend of cinnamon and nutmeg.  The combination of these two spices results in a balanced, pumpkin-pie flavor. \r\n\r\nThe overall character is a smooth, medium bodied ale spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg",

    "description": "We have added natural raspberry flavor to our UFO Hefeweizen to create this beer.  Consistent with the hefeweizen style, this beer is unfiltered and cloudy with a solid foamy head.  UFO Raspberry has a distinctive, hazy rose color.  The scent of fresh raspberries hits the nose immediately, along with a subtle bready aroma from the wheat and yeast.  The body is light and the unfiltered yeast provides a soft mouthfeel.  The taste of the fruit compliments the beer nicely, neither overwhelms the other.  There is a faint sweetness on the palate, which finishes cleanly in a semi-dry, tart finish.",

    "description": "We started the Harpoon Brewery in 1986 because, like today, we loved beer and wanted more good choices.  While traveling in Europe after college, we drank many wonderfully diverse, fresh, local beers.  We also saw firsthand how important local breweries were to their communities.  After our travels, we asked each other, why not bring great beer and that sense of community to New England?  That was the genesis of the Harpoon Brewery.  Twenty years later we still revel in making great beer and sharing that joy with our friends and neighbors.  The success that we have had running Harpoon is due entirely to the wonderful employees who brew, package, warehouse, sell, deliver, and market our beer and you, the people who drink Harpoon.  We hope that our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.",

    "description": "From their site:\r\n\r\n\"Harpoon IPA is an interpretation of the classic English style using hops and malt grown in the United States.\"\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\"The high hopping of Harpoon IPA is not only noticeable in the nose but especially in the finish. The lingering bitter finish of this beer is not harsh or astringent, but crisp and pronounced. This is created, in part, by dry hopping – a technique that involves adding fresh hops to the conditioning beer to provide a fresh hop aroma.\r\n\r\nThis beer is floral, medium body with an aggressive, clean hop finish.\"\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis has been my year-round favorite since moving to Boston in 2004.  It is the nectar of the gods.  Seriously, it's a nicely balanced, hoppy IPA that isn't overpowering.  Also, it can be consumed in huge quantities with no hangover.",

Our selection of hand crafted lagers and ales are produced on premises using the finest grains and hops. We brew small batches of about 100 gallons, ensuring that each beer is served at the peak of freshness. Our brews are available by the glass, pint, or pitcher and to-go in 1/2 gallon growlers and 5 gallon kegs. We make every attempt to keep all of our beers on tap at all times but once in a while one or two may not be available for a few days. These times are the perfect opportunity to stretch your taste and try something other than your favorite. Please let Bob or Donna, or any of the High Desert Brewing Co. staff know how you think we are doing.",

Hopworks has four distinct areas including a family friendly restaurant with play area, a vibrant bicycle bar, banquet mezzanine, and outdoor beer-garden.  Our 20 barrel brewery produces 3000 barrels a year and provides our restaurant with ten different HUB organic beers on tap and two cask ales at all times. We have parking for seventy cars, eight motorcycles and up to fifty bikes.  Our world-class beer, New York style pizza, and wonderful staff are some of the best you will find anywhere.",

Biscuity malt flavors meld with subtle plum and berry notes, produced by a special blend of English Old Ale and Chico yeasts. Brewed once a year, and aged for six months prior to release, the Jasperilla is smooth despite its 9% abv.\r\nJasper dressed as Hosehead from Strange Brew\r\n\r\nWe named this beer after our dog Jasper because he has brought so much joy to our lives. We got Jasper from a local dog rescue group called Mixed Breed Rescue. He has been a constant source of smiles and kept our spirits high through many late nights and long hours at the brewery.\r\n\r\nJasperilla is so good and smooth that you'll beg like a dog for more, roll over for a belly rub, howl at the moon...you get the picture.",

Just try to imagine a Pittsburgh football, baseball or hockey game without an ice cold Iron.\r\n\r\nWe still brew Iron City fresh daily – but now, instead of delivering it to Pittsburgh neighborhoods in horse-drawn buggies, we deliver it to your favorite hangouts. You can get an Iron at national restaurant chains, upscale eateries, and – of course – your favorite local bar. You can also find it at more than 330 regional beer distributors. Because Iron City is brewed locally, it goes from the brewery to you within a matter of days. You won’t find a fresher beer anywhere in Pittsburgh!",

    "description": "Schwarzbier means \"black beer\" in German. It is a medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid. The beer is often referred to as a Schwarzpils, a \"black Pils,\" but, unlike a blond Pils, which can be assertively bitter, the hop bitterness in Schwarzbier is always gentle and subdued.\r\n\r\nIn a glass, Schwarzbier looks much like a British dark ale, but looks can be deceiving. Schwarzbier, unlike a British ale, has a clean lager taste that leaves next to no perception of fruitiness on the palate. Instead, Schwarzbier produces very mild, almost bittersweet, notes of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Like most traditional German lagers, Schwarzbier has a malty middle, but the sweetness is never cloying or overpowering. The beer is moderately to well attenuated and the finish tends to be dry. Its alcohol level by volume is in the range of 4.5 to 5%, rarely higher. To accentuate the Schwarzbier's dark elegance and appealing head, always serve it in a tall, fluted or tulip-shaped glass.",

The first light-tasting ale introduced in Canada, Labatt 50 was Canada’s best-selling beer until 1979 when, with the increasing popularity of lagers, it was surpassed by Labatt Blue. Labatt 50 is fermented using a special ale yeast, in use at Labatt since 1933. Specially-selected North American hops and a good balance of dryness, complemented by a fruity taste, provide Labatt 50 with all the distinguishing features of a true ale.",

    "description": "Started in 1987, the microbrewery located on the Milwaukee River has become a Milwaukee landmark.  Its rich history includes partnerships with local taverns, preservation of local historical pieces, unique tours, family style dining options and most importantly, great beer. President Russ Klisch said it all started with his brother, Jim.  Jim expressed interest in beer making near his birthday and Russ humored him by purchasing him a book on the subject.  Jim read the book and brewed the beer.  Although not known, according to Russ, as a gourmet cook, Jim made a good beer.  Russ was impressed and decided he could do it better.  In short, sibling competitiveness and common interest lead both to entering contests in beer making.  They both received awards, and family and friends encouraged them to start the business. Their family had roots in the beer industry as well.  Their grandfather worked for Schlitz driving a street sweeper and a truck.  Russ Klisch remembers him bringing home short fills to his dad.  He recalls, even as a kid, that it was a cool job if you got to bring beer home at night.  Taverns were also owned by several family members. With that family history and their common interest in beer making, the brothers started their business.  They decided to start small.  Initially, they bought an old pizza bakery building down the street from their home in Riverwest.  They liked the location and the fact that they could walk there from home.  They sold their first barrel on December 2, 1987.  They stayed at that location until winter of 1998.",

In 2003, we brewed our first Double IPA, and haven't looked back since. This hop monster uses Premium American 2- Row and a touch of light crystal malt to create a solid malt foundation. The recipe calls for hops to be used in every step of the brewing process; in the mash, in a hop back, in the fermenter, and in the bright tanks. We use hop extract, hop pellets and hop flowers, hence the name Hop Juice. Hop Juice spends more than 4 weeks dry hopping in the fermenter and the bright beer tank. It is approximately 9.4% abv and has massive IBUs. Hop usage is over 4lbs per barrel. Hopeheads, step up to the plate!",

Our brewing process utilizes the traditional English method of upward infusion mashing in our combination mash lauter tun to create lagers and ales inspired by old world values, but with modern quality and consistency. The staff at The Lion Brewery is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships in recent years.",

Seeking knowledge and ingredients Smith joined with a small number of individuals who were laying the foundation of the craft beer movement in California. With a small group of investors Smith formed Mad River Brewing Company in 1989. Now in our 2nd decade we continue our commitment to producing fine ales combining the most traditional brewing methods with an environmentally sound approach. For centuries the English have been known for their brewing expertise. At Mad River Brewing Company we are long on tradition and continue to handcraft our ales in the truest sense.

    "description": "Whilst we wouldn’t recommend having this at breakfast with your bacon and eggs, our Coffee Beer is made with real coffee and has a caffeine hit to match. The natural flavours of the beans selected and hand roasted by our friends at the Union Coffee Roasters go well with the roast barley in the beer to give a silky-smooth drink with distinct chocolate and vanilla notes. \r\n\r\nOur first formulation of this beer was the first UK brewed beer to carry the Fairtrade logo, and, although we have reformulated it to create an even better blend of malt and roast coffee flavours, we can no longer get enough coffee in each bottle to qualify for Fairtrade status. However we are still using the same Faitrade Araba Bourbon beans from Rwanda’s Abuhuzamugambi Bakawa Co-operative.\r\n\r\nAt the Meantime Brewing Co we love flavour, so it wasn’t exactly difficult for us to see how the scents and aromas of coffee and barley would create a perfect match like just like mint and lamb, toffee and banana, peaches and cream, peanut butter and jam. Serve lightly chilled with as many chocolate truffles as your conscience allows.\r\n\r\nEach serving is equal to one cup of coffee",

Brewers Gabe Fletcher of Midnight Sun Brewing Company [Anchorage, AK] and Colby Chandler of Ballast Point Brewing Company [San Diego, CA] designed and brewed an exciting representation of their passions: hops, Belgian yeast, oak aging and Brettanomyces. \r\n\r\nJust prior to the Great Alaska Beer & Barley Wine Fest in JAN 2009, Gabe and Colby brewed a West Coast-worthy IPA at Midnight Sun Brewing Company. This hop-centric beer became the jumping-off point for other intense flavors. During its course to completion, 3767 was affected by three different yeast strains--including Brettanomyces, aged for several months in French oak Cabernet Sauvignon barrels, and then bottle- and keg-conditioned. \r\nThe plan is for 3767 to hit Anchorage, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and San Diego in NOV 2009 for a West Coast Toast. Here’s to the collaborative spirit readily found in our brewing industry. Clink!",

Though the recipe and process for Arctic Devil have evolved over the years, it is typically brewed in January then aged in oak barrels for several months before the entire batch is blended, bottled and released on the Friday after Thanksgiving. \r\n\r\nIn its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table. \r\n\r\nEach annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment. \r\n\r\nMidnight Sun's elusive Arctic Devil Barley Wine is Alaska's most awarded barley wine.",

Since taking over this mid-town establishment, the Pajaks added a “beer & wine license” and subsequently transformed the European-style café into a beer-centric place to grab breakfast, lunch, dinner and all beers during, around and between these fabulous meals. \r\n\r\nThe cafe's beer menu is extensive and all-encompassing. The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. And the beer pour is always right— temperature, glass, presentation. \r\n\r\n“No hops were harmed in the brewing of this beer.” \r\n\r\nGruit is an old style—one that incorporates spices, herbs and fruit but no hops. The latter detail makes this style very rare in modern times. Café Amsterdam’s Gruit is dark, strong and interesting. This combination of pale and dark malts, sage, thyme, cinnamon, black peppercorn and fresh orange peel composes distinctive, substantial flavors that meld together wonderfully. And at 12% ABV, this cellar-friendly ale is ready to lay you down! Thoroughly enjoy this old-world beer now but stash some away for later dwelvings. \r\n\r\nAvailability: \r\nAK - 22-oz bottles (limited release begins 05/29/2009)",

The first brewmaster was Michael Borchers which brought with him experience and used machines from the now defunct Silver Creek Brewing Corporation that was located in Sellersburg, Indiana. Jared Williamson and Jesse Williams are the current brewers working the brewery. In 2005, 14,000 gallons of beer was produced by the brewery, and with the new additions, the planned output for 2007 is double the 2005 amount.",

For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement.

So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel.",

We are very proud of our accomplishments thus far, and believe in earning our place in the brewing industry and in our customer's hearts and minds everyday. All of our beer is brewed in Holland, Michigan at one of our two locations. We brew, cellar and package the main brands for distribution at our production facility on the north-side of Holland, at 690 Commerce Court. In response to our considerable growth, we opened the new brewery in October of 2006, replacing the original headquarters.  We also brew beer and distill spirits in our pub. The pub is a great place for us to explore new ideas, meet our customers in a comfortable setting and provide a place of community for all who visit. The beers made here are typically special brews that rarely see their way outside of the friendly confines of our pub. In 2007, we brewed and shipped just over 7,400 barrels of beer. (A barrel = 31 gallons.) We work hard to bring you an authentic, interesting and gratifying experience.",

Some times, when we get a momentary glimpse of sanity, we ask ourselves what we have achieved. We think we can say that we have achieved some level of fame, at least locally and among dedicated beer geeks around the world. But more important - before we started Nøgne Ø most Norwegians did not know much about beer styles like IPA, Porter or Amber. This has for sure started to change, and we do feel that we have contributed to what you can call a renaissance of Norwegian beer-culture.  Diversity was one of our main goals - and it does seem like diversity in the world of beers is starting to come back.",

It is 8.7% alcohol by volume, and has 85 International Bittering Units. \r\n\r\nIt features a gooey, resiny aroma and a luscious mouthfeel. Gordon is brewed with dash of chocolate malt in it, to round out its load of hops and balance the beer. The result is an assertive yet exceptionally smooth version of strong beer.\r\n\r\nWe brew Gordon in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Colorado’s first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet, grade-A citizen, and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.\r\n\r\nOriginally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.\r\n\r\n--http://www.oskarblues.com/brew/",

    "description": "Emphasizing that complexity of character can arise from simple elements, this ale is made with three malts and one hop. Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesn’t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk, clean bitterness.",

    "description": "Originally brewed for thirsty British troops stationed on the subcontinent of India, India Pale Ales had to withstand the sea voyage around Africa. Brewers need to take full advantage of two preservatives at the time: hops and alcohol. They increased their hopping rates, doubled  their malt useage to increase alcohol content, and dry-hopped the brew before it set out on its voyage.\r\nOur Imperial IPA carries on this tradition- and then some!  The fruity and citrusy hop aroma intermingles perfectly with an assertive malty backbone.  Our brewers added a generous supply of hops to this brew throughout the entire process to provide an enormous hop flavor and balance the elevated alcohol content.\r\n\r\nThis beer is 11% alcohol by volume, and 135 IBU!",

Plenty of big malt flavors- chocolate and roasted- and high alcohol with lower carbonation and mild hops. \r\nWe brewed this beer with double the malts and four times the hops of regular stouts!\r\n\r\nOtter Creek Russian Imperial Stout clocks in around 10% ABV- a beer to be savored responsibly. True to style, this beer will last for years so you may want to stock up on a few bottles for your cellar while it's available.\r\n\r\nRussian Imperial Stouts pair well with creamy cheeses such as camembert (we recommend Vermont-made!), decadent chocolate desserts, or a hearty meal.",

    "description": "The name of the Paulaner brewery refers to the order of friars that resided in Neuhauser Straße in Munich who were part of the order of Saint Francis of Paola. The monks had brewed beer for their own use since 1634. The beer that was permitted to be sold on holidays was a Bock style which gained local fame. After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the Gebrüder Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas Bräu. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz. A daughter company is the Auer Bräu AG Rosenheim. Paulaner belongs to the BHI (Brau Holding International AG), a joint venture between Schörghuber Ventures (50.1%) and with Holland's Heineken N.V. (49.9%).",

All beers are made in accordance with the German beer purity law called the Reinheitsgebot which means that only the four classic ingredients are used in our beer: malted barley (and/or wheat), hops, water and yeast. Adjuncts such as corn and rice are never used. Preservatives and stabilizers are never used. High gravity brewing is never done. Just real, honest, all natural beer made the way it's made in Germany!",

    "description": "Our fourth in the Firehouse Ales Series, Pompier means \"fireman\" in French and represents our continued commitment to celebrate and honor the men and women who respond to the call day after day.  Pompier is rich and  smooth with complexities that come from a huge grain bill comprised of premium imported specialty malts, French Strisselspalt aroma hops and a 3 month aging process in oak hogsheads where it is combined with toasted French oak wood chips and champagne yeast.  Pompier is intended to be a vintage quality English-Style Barleywine with a French twist.  Appreciate its fine character and 12.1%ABV when we release this single 10 barrel batch sometime in December or you may choose to cellar it for many years to come.  \r\n\r\nYou will find Pompier on retail shelves packaged in the same 1 Liter Swing-Top bottle that has become a signature for our specialty beers.",

Like the history of brewing in Philadelphia the name Philadelphia Brewing Company has gone through many revivals. The same can be said of our brewery building - the former Wiesbrod and Hess Brewing Company complex in Kensington. At Philadelphia Brewing Co we take pride in our brews, our people, and our community. One person could never do everything that it takes to get beer into your glass. And it may sound obvious, but we won't brew anything that we wouldn't drink ourselves - you won't catch us drinking anything called Ultra unless it's a literal name meaning more flavor, more hops, more malt, more carbs. That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews. The specialty series will be driven by our individual brewers and the desires and whims of the rest of our family.  The beer is flowing at Philadelphia Brewing co! You can find our four brands on tap at finer establishments all around town!",

    "description": "Pizza Port was established in March of 1987 when we started making pizzas in our present location in Solana Beach! We started brewing beer as a hobby and as we began brewing more than we could leisurely drink, we really wanted to share some of the incredible brews that we created for fun with our customers too. We installed a 7 barrel brewery and served our first handcrafted beer brewed on the premises in October of 1992. In July of 1997, we celebrated our 10th anniversary by opening another location in Carlsbad. We expanded our brewing capacity into the building next door creating the opportunity to brew, bottle, distribute, and drink even more. Our distribution center is called PORT BREWING!  We found the perfect location in San Clemente and opened in July of 2003 enabling us to brew several additional styles! Let's party! When people started asking where they could get our beer besides Pizza Port enough, we acquired the old Stone Brewing facility in San Marcos at 155 Mata Way #104 to expand our distribution as PORT BREWING! We officially opened on Cinco de Mayo 2006. Now we will be able to make up to 10,000 barrels to get out to your other favorite places to enjoy coldies! More impressive is the 100 plus barrel room for all of our barrel aged specialties. Come check out our tasting bar where you can get bottles, jugs & merchandise to go while you sample what's brewing!",

When this happens, there are days when the tide just gets too high and flattens out the surf. The lineups shut down and surfers are left to wait until the High Tide recedes.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the tides to shift in your favor, might we suggest a High Tide IPA? Brewed only once each year to coincide with the Hop Harvest in Yakima Washington, High Tide IPA is made with 180 lbs of Fresh Hops per batch that are plucked from the vines and sent straight to our brewery. We skip the whole drying and processing stage which means the hops are ultra fresh and full of flavors we can't normally get. Like grapes, Hops are only harvested one time each year and as such, we make what we can when we get them.",

As you paddle out, a swell arrives from nowhere signaling your turn to go. The surf Gods are shinning on you today. You turn, stroke like mad for the wave. Standing up you are alone and blammo you Wipeout....blowing the only chance of a right hander all to yourself. You know who you are. We've all been there too. It's inside each and every one of us.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the waters of Wipeout IPA, a massively hopped India Pale Ale with enough substance and body to overcome even the worst and most tragic of on the water spills. We brew Wipeout IPA for everyone- especially those hardy souls who brave the cold winter water and monster sets produced by an amazing northwest swell. \r\n\r\nOnly a tidal wave of hops can overcome the surging tide of malt that is required to produce a beer of this shape. We invite you to drop in, hang on and kick out the backside. That is, unless you enjoy wiping out and all the glory that goes with it.\r\n\r\nMalts- Two Row, Wheat, Carapils and English Crystal Malts\r\nHops- Amarillo, Centennial and Simcoe \r\nYeast- White Labs California Ale\r\n\r\nOriginal Gravity- 1.064\r\nTerminal Gravity- 1.008\r\n7.0% ABV\r\n\r\nDraft- Available in Southern California and Arizona 22 Oz Bottles and Cases- At Port Brewing San Marcos and Pizza Port Carlsbad, San Clemente and Solana Beach and wherever better beers are sold.",

    "description": "The Portsmouth Brewery, New Hampshire's first brewpub, was founded in 1991, four years after its sister company, the Northampton Brewery, opened in Western Massachusetts. Peter Egelston, Head Brewer in Northampton from 1987 until 1991, moved to Portsmouth to set up the new brewery here. (Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) The brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list. Head Brewer Tod Mott arrived in late 2003, bringing with him is award-winning ways and oursized personality. All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company. --http://www.portsmouthbrewery.com/htmlpages.portsmouth/beerlist.html",

Its\r\nmature length is 5 cm and its diet varies by what flows into its cave,\r\nincluding shrimp, snails and amphipods. \r\n\r\nBlind Salamander Pale Ale is a blend of the finest pale malts and East Kent\r\nGoldings hops.

    "description": "Red Oak Brew Pub was opened in February of 1991. In addition to brewing according to the Law of Purity, we decided not to filter or pasteurize our Bavarian Lagers to ensure the vitamins remain whole for that rich, mellow taste. Within months of opening the pub we began selling Red Oak to other accounts in the Greensboro area. In no time the 6 original aging tanks were maxed out so we added on to the building and installed 13 new tanks. By 2001 Red Oaks popularity had grown so much that we were brewing 24/7...and out of aging capacity. We began the search for a location to build a larger brewery with space to accommodate future growth.  After settling on a 12 acre tract along I 40/85 between Greensboro and Burlington in 2003...we began discussions with 3 Bavarian Brewery fabricators. Rolec of Cheming, Bavaria was chosen to supply the new brewery; and in 2005 construction began on the building to house it.  By the summer of 2007 Red Oak was ready to open the nation's most modern computerized brewing facility...consistently producing the Freshest, Purest, Bavarian Lagers in America.",

    "description": "Rogue Ales was founded in 1988 by Jack Joyce, Rob Strasser and Bob Woodell, three corporate types who wanted to go into the food/beverage industry. Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles (inside).",

    "description": "An imperial bitter style using exotic traditional floor malts, citrus hoppy flavor, stupendous hop aroma. Hedonistic!\"Mellow Beer Emboldened by Hops,\" Elaine Louies article in the New York TimesDining Out Section, (March 24, 1999) announced the release of latest Rogue elixir to be bottled. The article states that \"The newest beer of Rogue Ales sounds more aggressive than it is. Brutal Bitter is actually full-bodied, deeply flavored, intensely hoppy brew. There is nothing brutal about the rich, deep, mellow taste. Its crackling but not sharp... This beer may raise eyebrows, but it wont pucker lips. The aftertaste is clean.\"\r\n\r\nRogue brewer John Maier describes his Brutal Bitter as a cross between a Very Extra Special Bitter and an Indian Pale Ale. Brutal Bitter was first brewed in 1996 for the 20th Anniversary of the Horse Brass Pub in Portland. Customer demand prompted Rogue to continue brewing Brutal for the Horse Brass as well as using it as Rogues premier pour at the 1998 Oregon Brewers Festival. At the 1999 SpringFest in Portland, Oregon, Brutal Bitter was unscientifically voted the Peoples Choice--it received twice as many votes as the runner-up.\r\n\r\nBrutal combines Oregon hops with English Malts. The Oregon grown Crystal hop is a triploid variety developed from the German Hallertau aroma hop variety with contributions from Cascade, Brewers Gold, and Early Green. Crystal is the only hop used in brewing Brutal and it provides a massive amount of aroma without dry-hopping. The English malts used are floor malted Pipkin (a mellow cross of Maris Otter and Warboys, from an English company called Beeston), Cara Vienna and Cara Wheat. Brutal Bitter is packaged in Rogues classic 22 ounce silk-screened bottle, 12-ounce 6-pack (new for 2005), and is available on draft.",

Soba has been a longtime staple of Japanese cuisine because of its nutritional value. Buckwheat is high in potassium, phosphorous, vitamin B (50 percent more than wheat) and protein, and its virtually fat-free. The fruits of buckwheat plant are like small beechnuts, which are milled to separate the edible groats from the dark brown hulls. The groats are then roasted and used more or less like a grain (a good example is Kasha).\r\n\r\nMorimoto Soba Ale is brewed with Roasted Buckwheat, Pale malt, Munich Malt, 13-17 Carastan Malt, and Crystal Hops. (Note, this beer contains Gluten.) The flavor is unique, toasty-nutty sensation with medium body and good hop bitterness.

Rogues barleywine is described by beer expert Stuart Ramsey as: \"A masterful, intense creation from brewer John Maier....it has achieved a depth and complexity usually associated with well-ages strong ales. I hope the brewery bottles some before it disappears.\" We call it the cognac of beers. An unfiltered and unfined Barleywine. Intense, robust, malty and dark. The cognac of beers. A hugh beer in a little bottle, this is a beer designed for sipping.\r\n\r\nOld Crustacean is brewed with eight ingredients, Great Western Harrington, Klages, Hugh Baird Carastan and Munich Malts, Chinook and Centennial Hops, free-range coastal water and PacMan yeast.

The beer is made with three malts in considerable additions that leave it with a more malty and sweet taste. There are five different hop additions that were carefully planed out to impart just enough bitterness to give it the body and depth that it needed without leaving you with the astringent and bitter aftertaste. We then added a plethora of English flavor and aroma hops that round out the floral and citrus esters. With the beer being so well balanced between bitter and sweet, we than added \"big sacks\" of bittering hops to the conditioning vessel to impart all the wonderful citrus and floral notes deep into the beer while leaving the bittering aspects of the hop behind. The result was a beer that makes you want to nose dive right in complimented by the well balanced taste of this wonderful brew.",

Fresh toasted pumpkins are added in the mash with the grains adding a touch of the season to the brew. The complex fruitiness and dryness of the yeast is enhanced by the addition of sugars during fermantation. The beer is lightly spiced with pumpkin spice, all spice, and brown sugar.

We brew this American Style Lager beer with three types of malt: pilsner, pale and carafoam which enhance the head retention of this beer. We then gingerly scatter some very light floral hops at the beginning to give it some esters and sweetness that compliment the watermelon. The true magic of this beer does not occur in the brewing process but in the conditioning vessel. This is where we add the best farm fresh local watermelon and than push the beer into it, allowing it to sit and saturate for a few weeks. By the time it is complete, we are left with a unbelievably smooth tasting beer with a beautiful aroma and subtle taste of watermelon that imparts its way into this already crisp lager. Truly our customers' favorite, this one will have you reaching for another glass soon after you put the first one down.",

During the burning, the brewery in town, \"Ludwigs Brewery\" operated by George Ludwig was burned to the ground by Confederate soldiers under Gen. McCausland. In remembrance of this event we created a German style rauchbier, or dark smoked lager. This beer uses all its ingredients from Bamberg, Germany, which is where the style was born and in by coincidence, the same area where Ludwig himself was born and taught to brew. It is made with a special birch wood smoked malt that imparts a light smoky aroma, taste, and dryness to the palate. The pilsner malt and noble German hops are used to balance this dryness making it very enjoyable as well as different. We believe this beer resembles how Ludwig himself might have brewed it over 100 years ago.",

We use torrified wheat, pale, and carafoam for balance, giving it a nice hazy, straw color and refreshing wheat taste. We ferment the White Horse at higher ale temps with a German style yeast that is known for producing world class wheat beers. We let the yeast take over the majority of the flavoring in our fermenters, providing the beer with banana and clove like esters. We pull some of the yeast with it to give this brew the proper style and to keep its body and character. We than age this brew with zests of citrus and a brewers spice that blends harmoniously with the esters of the yeast and balance out the sweetness of this brew.

There are notes of nutmeg, caraway and vanilla.  The taste starts with chocolate malt with a hint of spice and rolls into a warm spicy alcohol taste which has the effect of creating the balance that usually comes from the hop bitter.  There is some hop bitter on the finish, but not much.  Overall, this beer finishes relatively dry for such a big beer.  As it warms, the spices move forward in the taste and the chocolate moves to the finish.  The pumpkin provides a pleasant undertone and a nice mouthfeel.  The spices will probably fade some over time; they mellowed considerably while still in the fermenter.",

It is brewed with twice the ingredients of the Santa Fe Brewing Company's other beers, and only half the usual amount of liquid is extracted from these ingredients. This makes one substantial beer. At over ten percent alcohol, Chicken Killer is actually as substantial as wine, but this is not to say that it is difficult to drink. On the contrary; be careful with this one. The flavors of the beer are at first as overwhelming as the intense Santa Fe sun. But in the same way our sun gives us the unrivaled brilliant colors of Santa Fe, the potency of Chicken Killer gives us the remarkable spectrum of flavors that can be found in no other beer, in no other city.

No, this IPA has a top-secret recipe to thank for its success, and this meticulously formulated combination of several different hops combined with a very specific brewing process give Fiesta IPA a spicy, citric, and floral infusion of hop character, which is masterfully counterbalanced with the full-bodied maltiness characteristic of the Santa Fe Brewing Company’s distinctive beers.",

Inquiring whether it is a German, Czech, Bavarian, American, or any other style pilsner will result in an impatient sigh and the explanation that the whole philosophy behind this pilsner is that it does not fall into any categories. True, it is brewed with traditional ingredients (soft water, pilsner malt, saaz hops, and German yeast), but it is the way that these ingredients interact, and the characteristics of the yeast, that cause this particular pilsner to defiantly stand alone. The assertively hopped Freestyle pils exudes the flavor and the aroma of the classic Saaz hop (a tribute to “the original” pilsner), while maintaining enough body to balance but not overpower this hop’s pleasant, spicy tone. An unhurried lagering process so frequently overlooked by American craft brewers is strictly adhered to in the production of Freestyle, which makes this beer by far the most light, clean, and quenching beer in the Santa Fe Brewing Company’s line up.",

Supported by the complex, yet light body only possible with a good Irish yeast strain, this coffee-like creaminess eventually yields to the warmth of a subtle variety of hops, and their mild, full flavor. A favorite with regular customers, this rare brew can occasionally be found on draft at restaurants in Santa Fe, but is more likely on tap at the Brewery's tasting room. Despite its intimidating dark color, this brew has an uncanny ability to convert those who claim not to like beer.

Judges may not be able to define \"Radical Beer,\" but you'll damn well know it when you taste it. Bruce died, officially declared a pauper by the State of California, personally broken and financially bankrupt simply for challenging America's moral hypocrisies with words. The memorial playbill read: \"Yes, we killed him. Because he picked on the wrong god.\" -Directed by, the Courts, the Cops, the Church... and his own self-destructive super ego. Like Noah lying naked and loaded in his tent after the apocalyptic deluge: a witness, a patron saint, a father of what was to come.

This year, in celebration of our 27th year, we have made this beer available to the public for the first time, and aptly named it Anniversary Ale.    \r\n\r\nAnniversary Ale is an American-style IPA featuring Cascade hops, the signature hop used in our Pale Ale. The beer has a pronounced pine and citrus hop aroma balanced by the sweetness of two-row pale and caramel malts. The result is an unusually well-balanced IPA that proves an IPA can be both assertive and elegant. Anniversary Ale is a medium-bodied, well-hopped ale that finishes with a slight malt sweetness.",

All the hops in the beer are grown naturally on the premises of our brewery in Chico. We pick the hops ourselves and then take them directly to the brew kettle, without being dried, just after picking so they retain nearly all of their natural oils and resins. It is made with Cascade, Centennial and Chinook hops. Until now, this beer has only been available in draft. Starting this year, we will be bottling it on a very limited basis, with plans to expand its availability as we expand our Chico hop field in the coming years.",

    "description": "Sixpoint Bengali Tiger is reminiscent of the century-old English IPA. In my perspective, many current IPAs suffer from lacking substance; unbalanced by a hoppy assertiveness that is not substantiated by a strong foundation of rich malt flavors. Our interpretation uses the highest-quality, floor-malted base malt, which lends a full-bodied and rich caramel flavor. We mash at high temperatures and add generous amounts of specialty malts to further emphasize a strong foundation of malt as leverage for our generous additions of hops… Which are indeed generous. We use a total of three different hop strains, and add a total of six different additions throughout the process. The Bengali Tiger has a hoppy snap upfront, but strides at a steady pace, and finishes balanced. The signature characteristic of the Tiger is the aroma… we use massive quantities of whole East Kent Goldings hops to dry hop in our conditioning tanks. The result? The essential oils from the hops are an enticing treat before every sip. Notice the lacing of stripes around the pint glass as you finish your glass; it’s the mark of the Tiger.",

    "description": "Portsmouth is a colonial era seaport town, so it goes to follow that sooner or later we'd brew an India Pale Ale as a tribute to those big, hoppy 19th century ales that made the long sea voyage from England's temperate shores, 'round the Cape of Good Hope, to the sultry climes of the faraway East Indies.\r\n\r\nBut there's another reason we brewed this beer, one that's closer to our home and hearts. Hopheads. \r\n\r\nTen years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did, and we started to hear more and more: “Why don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?”\r\n\r\nYou could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think they’ll be quite pleased.",

Recipes calling for the use of pumpkins in beer date back to early colonial times, when brewers sought to extend their supply of costly imported malt with locally grown ingredients, such as squash and “pompions.”\r\n\r\nIn that spirit, we brew our ale with the addition of pumpkin to the mash, along with traditional spices to create a delicious American original.",

So, here in Jackson Hole, we only produce about 5,000 barrels of award-winning beer per year. We operate a 15 barrel, steam fired brew house and hand craft our lagers and ales using several yeast strains along with hops and grains from the United States, British Isles and Europe. The SRB Brewery was also granted Organic certification in 2007 allowing us to create our first Organic Certified beer OB-1, an english style brown ale, which is fast becoming a favorite among our patrons.",

    "description": "Southern Tier Brewing Company was founded in 2004 by Phineas DeMink and Allen Yahn with the vision of bringing small batch brewing back to a region rich in brewing tradition. In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.",

    "description": "Pumking is an ode to Púca, a creature of Celtic folklore, who is both feared and respected by those who believe in it. Púca is said to waylay travelers throughout the night, tossing them on its back, and providing them the ride of their lives, from which they return forever changed. Brewed in the spirit of All Hallows Eve, a time of the year when spirits can make contact with the physical world and when magic is most potent. Pour Pumking into a goblet and allow it’s alluring spirit to overflow. As spicy aromas present themselves, let it’s deep copper color entrance you as your journey into this mystical brew has just begun. As the first drops touch your tongue a magical spell will bewitch your taste buds making it difficult to escape the Pumking.",

British soldiers on their way to India drank a lot of beer, but found it would go stale on the long voyages.  Meanwhile, brewers knew that by adding more hops the beer would stay fresh.  Voila!  A new style was born and it is one we are proud to brew.  Southern Tier IPA is triple-hopped on its journey to your glass for a fully aromatic experience.",

The contribution of color comes directly from the color of malt that we use.  Some malt is oasted to achieve dark color and coffee-like flavor which in turn get transferred to the beer.\r\n\r\nOur Porter is ruchly complex with overtones of chocolate and expresso beans followed by a subtle flavor of hops.  It's a nourishing beer without being too sweet or filling.",

The locals swear that the tormented souls of the inmates will torture anyone brave enough to attempt passage through the Seven Gates of the forest.\r\n\r\nSpring House Brewing Co. honors the local legend by producing a terrifyingly delicious brew that is as familiar as a friendly forest, yet possesses a mysterious quality that will haunt you from the first taste.

Often they arrive with a glazed look in their eyes, having endured days of office drudgery or the unknowable hardships of securing a parking spot. Set your cares aside, for all can find solace in this ale's yin-yang of nutty maltiness and delicate, dryish hoppiness.

New malting techniques led to the development of pale malt, a barley malt kilned at low temperatures which contributed very little colour to the finished beer. Hence the birth of Pale Ale, an amber- to copper-coloured ale you could actually see through. Plenty of British Crystal malt in the grist lends this ale its rich colour, its caramel maltiness, and adds the occasional whiff of toffee to the nose. An addition of American and German hops to the kettle at the end of the boil is used to suffuse our Pale Ale with a gently spicy hop finish.",

This beer is made with 40% wheat malt and is brewed with a special yeast that tends to stay in suspension, giving the beer its cloudy appearance. Bavarians are so convinced of the healthful qualities of this yeasty brew that doctors there are known to prescribe two Hefeweizens a day to feeble patients. The yeast used for this brew also imparts its unique spicy, clovey flavour. Some people even detect a light banana flavour. All of these wacky flavours are the natural 'signature' left by this specific yeast strain during its fermentation of the beer and no additional spices are added.",

Zwickl-beer is not filtered and therefore shows some cloudiness due to rests of yeast, minerals and trace elements.\r\n\r\nThis very special beer is brewing at its best using a sophisticated recipe combined with love and dedication. Stiegl only uses excellent ingredients from Austrian agricultural suppliers, applying biological techniques. As a result of this Paracelsus Zwickl beer was awarded the Bio-Austria certificate. Bio-production is subject to strict yearly controls by “Austria-Bio-Guaranty”.\r\n\r\n“Bier is a really divine medicine”. This quotation comes from Paracelsus (1493 – 1541). He was a well known physician, forward thinker and visionary who lived in Salzburg for many years. He found out that beer had healing powers.",

Our Stone 10th Anniversary Ale weighs in at 10% alcohol by volume (perfect for a 10th anniversary beer), and has a little more color and malt character than our other IPAs. In addition to using the new Summit hop variety in the brewhouse to provide the powerful bitterness, we went back through our records and found some of our favorite hops over the years, and used them to flavor this brew, including Chinook, Crystal, and large doses of Simcoe in the dry-hop to provide a huge, complex, piney, fruity and floral hop character.

The first was Jeremy Moynier’s incredibly delicious Oatmeal Stout, and the second was Jake Ratzke’s amazing homebrewed Imperial Stout that had authentic Oaxacan chocolate added to the boil. We loved both beers so much that we decided to combine the recipes to make this year’s Anniversary offering: Stone 12th Anniversary Bitter Chocolate Oatmeal Stout. This beer pours deep black with a rich brown head of foam. The aroma is dominated by roast malt and cocoa. Upon tasting, the cocoa (we used unsweetened, unprocessed cacao sourced through our friends at Chuao Chocolatier) really comes through with a deep chocolate flavor and a long lasting bitter finish. The roasted grains used add coffee and licorice accents. It is a thick beer, but not sweet, with the addition of oatmeal in the mash providing a rich, silky mouthfeel that adds to the creamy texture.",

Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive crossing the orbit of Mercury twice. The grist is 100% Gambrinus premium 2-row barley malt, copiously hopped with fresh Centennial and Willamette. The result is a rich, golden, intense beer with bitterness in perfect balance with residual sweetness.",

This is the beer that would come to mind while spending the last two years tearing down walls, hanging sheetrock, moving kegs, power washing the ceilings, arguing with various agencies, and cutting the water main. \r\n\r\nWithout Golden Promise malt, made by family-owned Simpsons Malt, Furious would just be pissed off-ed. From Scotland, this malt is still produced in the tradition of turning over the barley by hand, resulting in a malt that is unsurpassed in its quality. Golden Promise is also used extensively by premium whisky distilleries such as The Macallan. This malt provides the backbone for the intense hop character. Four American hop varieties are used at a rate of over three pounds per barrel. The result is a rich malt sweetness infused with bright hop flavor and aroma from beginning to end. Oh yeah, it's about 6% alcohol and around 100 IBUs.",

You can find dry stouts, milk stouts, Imperial stouts, American stouts, and even stouts made with oats.\r\n\r\nAt the Church Brew Works we have crafted delicious Toasted Oatmeal Stout.  The oats were blended with the best barley malt we have – and we didn’t stop there.  To give this beer a wonderful roasted flavor, we added unmalted, very darkly roasted barley.  The roasted barley is mixed with a generous portion of chocolate colored malt giving the Blast Furnace Stout a beautiful ruby hue.\r\n\r\nWe used our finest hops unsparingly to create a delicately balanced bitterness with a rich roastiness and fresh hop aroma. The Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops were added with heavy hands at two different times.  This unbridled addition grants a full hop flavor to our heavenly drink.\r\n\r\nA typical oatmeal stout is a bit lower in alcohol than most other stouts as does the Blast Furnace Stout.  Ours, though not typical, does have a welcome medium body.  As you drink this beer, notice the rich, creamy brown head.  Drink it slowly and savor the flavors.

Allay your fears my friends because I’m going to tell you.  A hefe weizen is a special style of beer made with malted wheat and malted barley.  Hefe weizens are from Germany.  This beer is top fermented (an ale) with a very special yeast.  The Hop levels are kept deliberately low in order to bring out the character of the yeast.  If you notice the nose of the beer, it has a clove-like or fruity aroma.  The grain bill includes 50% wheat malt and 50% barley malt.  It is served very carbonated and a touch cloudy.  It is cloudy because it is served unfiltered.  The remaining yeast contributes flavor, adds B vitamins, and improves the beer as it ages.",

In the silence of passing seasons, they pray, they brew and retire in solitary existence behind the sheltering walls. They live a most interesting life. Most likely one we couldn’t sustain.\r\n\r\nNearby, each summer, the trellised fields spring to life as rows of resinous green cones are trained toward the heavens. Rumor is some monks love these hops and being surrounded by budding yellow aromas and the leafy pungent fields inspired them.

    "description": "Timmermans brews only traditional Lambic; the basic beer that, from spontaneous fermentation, is used throughout the entire range. Brewing Lambic, without adding yeast, is a complex and subtle art requiring recipes and patience passed on by the family. Lambics survive thanks to a handful of Brussels breweries and the presence of two micro-organisms that exist only in the Senne Valley: Brettanomyces Bruxellensis and Brettanomyces Lambicus. By adding fruit and spices, the magic of traditionallymade beers unravels: Strawberry, Kriek, Pêche, Framboise, Forest Fruit, but also Oude Gueuze, Kriek Retro, Gueuze, Faro or Lambicus Blanche. A unique site: open daily (including weekends), booking required. Possibilities for your meetings and banquets.",

Even though this beer was retired almost six years ago, we still get numerous Tröegs old-schoolers (Martha) begging for its return.\r\n\r\nWell hang onto your boot straps because Scratch #11 is about as close as we can get to the original ESB without firing up the old brew kettle. The Scratch #11 recipe originates from Chris’ stint at England’s University of Sunderland brewing program. After returning to Colorado the brothers drew on Chris’ experience and brewed pilot batches tweaking that recipe. The ESB production recipe has direct bloodlines to these pilot batches.\r\n\r\nThe Thames Valley ale yeast and the roasted barley create a biscuit flavor with nutty undertones. Combining these flavors with the earthiness of East Kent Golding hops creates one hell of a fine session beer. Take in the deep mahogany beauty of this beer and breathe in the full hoppy nose. It’s not the ESB, but it’s damn special.",

They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops.\r\n\r\nSome stories have twists, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery. Risking life and limb (while keeping his mouth open to sample the beer), a heroic brewery team member took the dive reconnecting the valve and saving about half the batch of Scratch #19.\r\n\r\nSo for your amusement (and our final relief), we give you a draft-only release of a third-take on a style that demands continued research for the Troegs Brewery staff.

    "description": "Phuket Beer was created as a refreshing ‘boutique’ beer in view of the exotic island of Phuket with a much lower formula of bitterness than any other domestic rivals in Thailand.\r\n\r\nPhuket Beer is the first regional beer brewed in Thailand and is positioned to appeal to both the international markets as well as the local population. This is manifested through the label and packaging designs presented in both English and Thai languages.\r\n\r\nPhuket Beer is well positioned as a premium brand located somewhere between the local standard brands and the imported premium brands. The efforts were inspired from the feeling of being in a tropical paradise. Thai beer consumers have become more sophisticated over the years, by selecting and demanding premium and high-end beers. initial consumer target was Phuket Island's significant tourist sector, a sector that is prone to taste and drink locally produced brands.However, strategic positioning and selected marketing of Phuket Beer has resulted in a ray of successful export markets with overwhelming response from the initial markets overseas.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy is to provide a ‘tropical lifestyle’ drinking experience in a fresh clean light tasting lager beer with 5% alcohol by volume, which is in total contrast to the other Thai beers that are very bitter with higher alcohol content.",

(Check the News section opposite for seasonal release dates and related celebrations.) The Tap Room restaurant offers an eclectic menu of great pub grub (signature nachos, rib tips like no others) plus dinner fare that addresses sophisticated palates with cuisines from around the world. (Yes, we're a brew pub, but our wine list is excellent). Better yet, sign on to our Upland Update to learn who's performing. And while you're here be sure to check out the weekly dinner specials from the fertile imaginations of our excellent restaurant crew. Part of a group that's interested in brewing? Arrange for a brewery tour. We are proud of our hand-crafted, award-winning beers and would be delighted to guide you through the many stages involved in the brewing process. In the meantime, take the Virtual Tour for an inside look at how glorious stainless steel can be when directed to perform a noble task! Most of all, everyone here welcomes you to come by and partake of the Upland Experience�where great food, great beer, and great friends come together. Can't get to Bloomington? No problemo.

Adventures in biking, canoeing, and hiking that led the trio to the northern New England states allowed them to visit some of the first operating craft breweries. Armed with a we can do this attitude the three cast off from their careers in engineering and biology to found the Wachusett Brewing Co. in 1993. Wachusett Country Ale was introduced to beer fans of Massachusetts the next year after lots of experimenting to get the formula just right. When Wachusett opened, the three designed and built most of the equipment; did the brewing and filling, selling and delivering, and everything else that a small startup brewery needed. Ned, Kevin and Peter are now backed by some of the most passionate and capable co-workers in the industry. Wachusett Ales continue to be hand crafted with the finest ingredients available, bottled and kegged in our Westminster facility. The three have never strayed from their plan to brew and sell the freshest, highest quality beers possible.",

The brewery was founded in 1436 when the brothers Schorer acquired the rights to brew and open a tavern. After establishing property for bottling they soon began brewing on what would become the foundations of the Wernesgrüner Pils Legend. It is known as the aforementioned Pils Legend, because it was a bitter specialty during the communist period in Germany. [1] Throughout the company's history it has endured numerous changes of ownership. In 1762 the Günnel family bought the Schorer brewery. In 1774 the Männel family took over the bottling properties. Even though at the end of the 19th century the label now had five independent breweries, the families were still competing with each other. By 1910 the company had established itself throughout Germany and the Netherlands, and was even served on the renowned Hapag-Lloyd ships that ran from Hamburg to America.[1] The company was acquired by the Bitburger Braugruppe GmbH in 2002. The current output is 850,000 hl per year.",

Copper-amber in color, AutumnFest is made with Vienna and Munich malts for that authentic, Bavarian easy drinking taste.  Each sip imparts a wonderful roastiness of malt on the tongue followed by a smooth, consistent finish.  Wonderfully balanced with a clean, velvety, slightly fruity taste, AutumnFest is the perfect beer for the Fall- a nice transition between the lighter beers of summer and the darker, heavier winter brews. It's a favorite of many Weyerbacher aficionados, who anticipate the end of summer with this wonderful beer. \r\n\r\n   Weyerbacher AutumnFest ( ABV 5.4%) is generally available in stores August through December.  Pick up a case to celebrate the change of seasons. Prost!",

Blanche, meaning \"white\", takes its name from the whitish haze in this pale gold brew, which is a result of the raw wheat and wheat malts used to brew this Belgian-style beer. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, Blanche was named as Best of the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast in the Belgian Specialty category at the US Beer Tasting Championships.\r\n\r\nWhite beers are well known as the principal product from Hoegaarden, a small town in a wheat-growing region east of Brussels.  Light, cloudy and smooth, Weyerbacher Blanche brings you authentic Belgian-style flavor along with microbrewed quality and freshness.\r\n\r\nBlanche is a thirst quenching beer that combines character and flavor with a moderate alcohol content.  Just try a bottle.  In the nose you'll notice spiciness from the coriander seeds and dried curacao orange peels added during the boil.

To be true to the style, Merry Monks' Ale is bottle conditioned. This means we add a bit of sugar and yeast just prior to bottling. This imparts a special effervescence to the beer, a creamier carbonation, and also extends the shelf life. The on-going fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages, and you'll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation. We suggest storing at cellar temperatures -around 55 degrees F- and away from light.\r\n\r\nWhen you try this beer you're in for a unique treat. The special effervescence and creaminess are immediately apparent when pouring. The Pilsner malts combined with the Belgian yeast strains  yield a remarkable and complex flavor- perhaps you'll note subtle hints of fruit or spice. The flavor is nicely balanced and the finish moderate to dry , begging for the next sip.\r\n\r\nYou might ask why we go through all this trouble and expense for just a beer, but one taste and you'll know the Merry Monks' Ale (9.3% ABV) will more than complement any meal it accompanies.

    "description": "At Weyerbacher we've created a Winter Ale that is a must for any malty beer lover. Winner of a Silver Medal in the 1998 World Beer Championships, Weyerbacher Winter Ale is brewed with deep-roasted chocolate malt. The taste predominates with a warm, roasty flavor, balanced out with a slightly dry finish. It's smooth but not cloying, with a warming belt of alcohol (5.6% ABV).\r\n\r\nAlthough winter ales predate history, they are believed to have their origin in the pagan celebrations of winter solstice. Later, when monasteries produced the local brew, winter ales were made each year to commemorate the birth of Christ. Back then, winter ales were brewed full-bodied as a source of nutrition for the upcoming winter months. Today, winter ales are typified by their seasonality, their rich, malty flavors and by their deep, dark coloration.\r\n\r\nGenerally available November-March, Weyerbacher Winter Ale is the perfect libation for a winter meal, with good friends, or beside a warm fire fending off a cold winter night.",

Crafted in a unique two-stage European brewing style for enhanced bitterness, it utilizes both conventional kettle hopping and dry hopping after fermentation resulting in a dry sharp finish. Brewed with select hops, its distinct robust flavor is derived from a delicate combination of sweet maltiness and lingering herbal bitterness. Lord Chesterfield Ale's bright gold color is complemented by a lightly laced foam head and fragrant zesty aroma. This fine Ale compares with the very best crafty-style beers. It pairs flawlessly with many foods including seafood dishes and fine cheeses.",
