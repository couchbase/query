# Relative links point to a location relative to the REST API reference page by default.

# The output of this spec is used in more than one location.
# The x-desc-refs attribute is used to override links when content is transcluded to other locations.

# The AsciiDoc Markdown converter does not recognize HTML tags like <a id="foo">.
# Use the x-desc-name vendor extension to specify the anchor for a property.

# The x-desc-more attribute provides additional descriptive text for the static AsciiDoc output.
# It is not displayed in the Redocly output.

          Polling the active requests again may return different values.

          A join would probably involve two or more fetches, one per keyspace.
          A union select would have twice as many operator counts, one per each branch of the union.
        example:
          {

        format: bytes
        description: |-
          The memory session size for the request, in bytes.

          Each request has a dedicated memory session.
          When a query requires a document or value, memory is allocated from this session based on the size of the document or value.
          Once the document or value is processed, the allocated memory is returned back to the session, enabling it to be reused by the request.

          This metric is available only when `node-quota` and `node-quota-val-percent` are configured for the node.
      state:
        type: string
        description: |-
          The state of the query execution, such as `completed`, `running`, `cancelled`.

          Note that the `completed` state means that the request was started and completed by the Query service, but it does not mean that it was necessarily successful.
          The request could have been successful, or completed with errors.

          To find requests that were successful, use this field in conjunction with the `errorCount` field: search for requests whose state is `completed` and whose error count is `0`.

        A field:value pair describing a field in the query plan, and the value that the field must have for the request to be logged.
        The name of the property is the name of the field in the query plan.
        The value may be a string, number, array, or any other JSON value.

        Within a single JSON object, if multiple field:value pairs are specified, then all pairs must be matched (using AND).
        For example, `{"index": "ix1", "#operator": "IntersectScan"}` specifies that if the query plan has an `index` field with the value `"ix1"` AND has an `IntersectScan` operator, then the request should be logged.

        Within an array of JSON objects, each field:value pair must be unique, but fields can be repeated.
        For example, `[{"index": "ix1"}, {"index": "ix2"}]` specifies that if the query plan has an `index` field with the value `"ix1"` AND another `index` field with the value `"ix2"`, then the request should be logged.
