          It is not a hard, absolute limit, and memory usage may exceed this value.

          When set to `0` (the default), the Query service sets a default soft memory limit for every node.
          To do this, the Query service calculates the difference between the total system RAM and 90% of the total system RAM:

          `Total System RAM - (0.9 * Total System RAM)`

          - If the difference is greater than 8 GiB, the default soft memory limit is set to the total system RAM minus 8 GiB.

          - If the difference is 8 GiB or less, the default soft memory limit is set to 90% of the total system RAM.
